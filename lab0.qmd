## Load Packages

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(datasauRus)
```

## Exercise 1

The datasaurus_dozen file has 1846 rows and 3 columns. The three variables are dataset, x, and y.

## Exercise 2

```{r}
#| label: plot-dino
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")
ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
#| label: cor-dino
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

## Exercise 3

(Add code and narrative here as needed. Note the code chunks below are labeled with `plot-circle` and `cor-circle` to provide spaces to place the code for plotting and calculating the correlation coefficient.)

(When you have finished, delete these instructions.)

```{r}
#| label: plot-circle
# Your code should go here! This is a comment, which should be deleted.
```

Some more narrative can go here.

```{r}
#| label: cor-circle
# Calculate the correlation here
```

Conclude with some more narrative, if needed.

## Exercise 4

(Add a labeled code chunk and narrative here. Insert code chunks using the "insert chunk" button (a green C with a +). Alternatively, use CMD + OPTION + I (Mac) or CTRL + ALT + I (Windows).)

## Exercise 5

(Add a labeled code chunk and narrative here. Insert code chunks using the "insert chunk" button (a green C with a +). Alternatively, use CMD + OPTION + I (Mac) or CTRL + ALT + I (Windows).)
